# Issue 001 - Solitary House in the Fields

![](https://i.imgur.com/NHxtyPE.jpeg)

The cover photo was taken during a gathering with my lab mates. I remember we had tofu pudding and a table full of dishes. After finishing our meal, while taking a walk back, we came across this scene: a field filled with golden wheat, with a small gray house in the center, standing quite isolated. It exuded a sense of American rural solitude.

### [RemoveAdblockThing](https://github.com/TheRealJoelmatic/RemoveAdblockThing)

Recently on GitHub's Trending, a method was provided to bypass YouTube's adblocker detection, allowing ads to be skipped even if blocked by the video player.

Direct script link (provided that the Tampermonkey extension is installed):

### [Phew AI Tab](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/phew-ai-tab-ai-auto-group/ccnagafbnapafjidkhbgligfoccmjddb)

Chrome extensions lack the built-in categorization feature found in Edge, and when too many tabs are open, they become densely compressed.

![](https://i.imgur.com/6Ju2EcD.png)

The effect after use is as follows: the tags are similar to the categorization tags of Edge, and they are automatically categorized by AI. They can be classified according to the content or the first letter, and can also be categorized by domain name or custom settings.

### [MaxFocus:Link Preview](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/maxfocus-%E9%93%BE%E6%8E%A5%E9%A2%84%E8%A7%88/bnacincmbaknlbegecpioobkfgejlojp)

You may have used the Max feature in the Arc browser where keeping the mouse over a link for a prolonged period pops up the webpage of that link, and it also offers powerful features after the pop-up:

- Reading Mode (The popped-up webpage can switch to reading mode, which is quite impressive)
- AI Tools (These are available only with a Pro subscription, but you get a trial period to try them for free initially)
- Zoom in and out functionality
- It also includes numerous other features to explore on your own

> After all this talk, it's better to try it yourself. Just like browsing Xiaohongshu, clicking on the link is quite convenient. When you hover your mouse over the image, the webpage pops up automatically, which is really cool!

### [simple-one-api](https://github.com/fruitbars/simple-one-api)

This project converts some free APIs resulting from the price wars among major companies (Qianfan Large Model Platform, iFlytek Spark Model, Tencent Hunyuan, MiniMax, Deep-Seek, etc.) into a universal OpenAI format interface, offering a one-time configuration. When I previously deployed it, I configured Baidu and Spark Models, and after configuration, it could be started with a single click, which was very convenient!

Additionally, from the recent commits, it seems the author has added support for free Cloudflare AI and Coze (coze.com).

### [STranslate](https://github.com/ZGGSONG/STranslate)

In the 000th issue, I casually recommended some efficiency tools to everyone without an introduction. After a day of experiencing all the efficiency tools and several days of STranslate experience, I have a certain understanding of this software: If you have a Mac and like to use [Bob](https://github.com/ripperhe/Bob), then I believe you will like this: `A translation and OCR tool developed with WPF/WPF that is ready to use and go as soon as you open it.`

> Currently, I have set Alt+C for word translation and Alt+X for clipboard monitoring. With AI, it feels much better than [openai-translator](https://github.com/openai-translator/openai-translator).

![](https://i.imgur.com/e3TWtWw.png)

### [Manga Translate](https://manga-translate.com/)

The website claims:
> No matter if your favorite comics are in Japanese, Korean, or any other language, Manga Translate can help you overcome the language barrier and enjoy a seamless reading experience.

The tool is still in the development stage, but there is already a demo page available for everyone to preview. For those interested, you can fill in the email address on this website, and when it goes live, an email will be sent out.

### [Modern Cookie Manager: Best Cookier](https://github.com/Dolov/chrome-best-cookier)

A Cookie Manager plugin offers convenient functions for adding, deleting, modifying, and querying, monitoring all JavaScript operations on cookies, along with 32 theme colors.

> I just came across this plugin this week and haven't had a deep experience with it, but the author's requirement is: there are many iterative projects within the company, and cookies are used to direct traffic to different branches.

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/m6RkgQvxtAqGmVCSEFB-_0uc8nZ80BzNmIiaITLPK5QTVswyWj5800Y_xnoRSlBn9s6lqup3MAUmd2VJeiW-YbMIwIU=s800-w800-h500)

> More comprehensive and aesthetically pleasing than the Cookie Editor!

### [Tiangong Music Web Version](https://music.tiangong.cn/)

A long time ago, Tian Gong launched the AI music creation feature, but it was not released on the web version. This week, I suddenly saw it while surfing and decided to share it with everyone. The creative effect is quite good, but the human voice sounds a bit "muddy."

### [Wanzhi: A Product of the Zero One Large Model](https://www.wanzhi.com/home)

I was going to recommend it on TG before, but many others have already done so, so I didn't. It seems that Wanzhi lacks the multimodal recognition capability for images on the computer side (at least as of June 11, 2024), and can only read documents and have dialogues, which makes it feel not as good as [Yuewen](https://yuewen.cn/chats/new) that I recommended before, but its document reading capability is indeed very good, worth a try!

> Fun Fact: Wanzhi is an all-in-one AI work platform integrating AI dialogue chat, document reading, and PPT creation, launched by Zero One Intelligence, an artificial intelligence startup founded by Kai-Fu Lee.

### [MP3PAW](https://v4.mp3paw.link/en/)

A YouTube music search engine, more accurately described as a tool for converting videos to MP3 format for listening, akin to many plugins that convert Bilibili videos to music. The download speed is somewhat slow, and it's unclear whether this is due to internet speed issues.

![](https://i.imgur.com/t8hp245.png)

### [cobalt](https://cobalt.tools/)

Similarly, it's a website that allows you to download YouTube videos, but it also supports downloading content from bilibili, Twitter, TikTok, and more. You can view the list of supported services under the "about" section. Additionally, you have the option to set the download resolution in the "settings."

![](https://i.imgur.com/qEYp2eN.png)

### [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/)

An open-source virtual hand-drawn style whiteboard that has been gathering dust in my favorites for years. At first, I thought I would make full use of this high-value thing, so one day I opened a link shared by someone and found that this whiteboard had been in my collection, conservatively estimated to be 2 years already.

### [stream-rec](https://github.com/hua0512/stream-rec)

A Kotlin automatic streaming media recording tool that supports most platforms and also provides a user-friendly front-end management interface. It can record bullet comments and can be deployed using Docker.

### [AppFeeds](https://appfeeds.info/)

An international trending topics list, currently featuring: GitHub, HackNews, HuggingFace, ProductHunt, TechCrunch, Businesslnsider, and now, another addition to the list of websites for casual browsing.

### Some Insights for Later Reading

I purchased an annual membership for both `五彩` and `Cubox`, and lightly used `Omnivore`. I have gained some understanding of these read-it-later services. Here is a screenshot of my memberships:

![](https://i.imgur.com/FfqFzso.png)

![](https://i.imgur.com/0hakglY.png)

Let's discuss the differences between members and non-members: Both `五彩` and `Cubox` require a membership for heavy usage, while light usage is not a concern. 

Personally, I don't have a habit of underlining or taking notes, so in my usage scenario: `Cubox > 五彩 > Omnivore`. However, if `Cubox` membership expires, I might switch to `Omnivore` since it's open-source and free.

This week while surfing the net, I came across a self-hosted read-it-later program [Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder). Its biggest selling point is the ability to use ChatGPT for automatic tagging. It's a lazy person's way of adding bookmarks, automatically fetching the titles, descriptions, and images of the links, and also supports Chrome and Firefox plugins, as well as iOS and Android apps.

The Github homepage of [Hoarder](https://github.com/hoarder-app/hoarder) also provides some insights into the use of read-it-later apps, suggesting that the author is a heavy user of such services.

### iOS welcomes a major update

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1L7421d7xw/

After watching this video, three updates that left a deep impression: the calculator now features AI calculations and handwriting copy-paste (amazingly powerful), learning from competitors' ecosystem interconnectivity, and Siri's intelligence is finally set to improve, with support from OpenAI.

### Interesting survey of "少数派"

https://sspai.com/bullet/1716277043

Most people use Amap and Apple Map, and Apple Map uses Amap's data. After browsing the comment section, I found that even people from Chongqing use Amap, which indicates that Amap is indeed doing a good job.

> 冷知识：[In 2014, AutoNavi belonged to Alibaba Group.](http://map.amap.com/about/)

### It's hard to believe that "食贫道" also filmed alternative cuisine.

https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1Ax4y1W7Qs/

At `11:26`, it can be watched repeatedly; the second one at `12:32` is a continuous shot.

### Two interesting GitHub projects this week

pyvideotrans：https://github.com/jianchang512/pyvideotrans

> PyVideoTrans is a tool that translates videos from one language to another and adds voiceovers. It supports both machine translation and AI translation, as seen on GitHub.

aider：https://github.com/paul-gauthier/aider

> Aider is an AI programming assistant in the terminal that works best with GPT-4o and Claude 3 Opus, and can connect to nearly all LLMs.
