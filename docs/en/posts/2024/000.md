# Vol. 000 - A New Beginning

![](https://i.imgur.com/1AXGkT0.jpeg)

This image is a photograph of a weather phenomenon I took in front of the train station near my home before heading back to school for my graduation defense. It was quite a shock!

## >>> Opening of the Weekly

**Why I Started My Journey with a Weekly Newsletter**

I have already introduced in detail on the channel `RrOrange and Friends`:

> I really enjoy exploring websites that are quirky and those that improve efficiency, as well as tool websites for efficiency, and I also have a great passion for gaming content. Friends around me often ask me for recommendations on websites and the like. However, with too much inventory, I didn't know who to recommend some things to, which led to the creation of this channel!

But, some channels have copied my content so thoroughly that there's nothing left.

> Technology is not inherently good or evil, it's the people who use it that determine its morality.

I cannot defend my copyright in the Telegram Report, so I have to use other ways to solve the problem. Below are some evidence I found:

My content:

The channel that plagiarized me:

There are many more, but I won't list them one by one. The road is long and winding, and it has scraped a lot of content from various channels. So I decided to start my own newsletter, so I don't have to worry every day about what to post. At least now, posting a newsletter might make me more immersed!

**Why It's Called RrOrange**

- Previously, my WeChat and QQ nickname was `Orange Domain`, and later when many websites required an English name, I casually came up with this name starting with Rr.
- I also have many open-source projects, and active community friends also call me `Big Orange`.

**Publication Time**

- If the content is rich, it is expected to be published every Saturday/weekend.
- If the mind is exhausted, new content will be published as the situation allows.

**Content Introduction of the Newsletter**

This newsletter will include the following content:

- **Fun and Useful Tools Collection**: Sharing interesting websites, app applications, resource sharing, and efficiency software tool collections that I see while surfing the internet daily.
- **Cutting-edge Tools Collection**: New AI content, AI applications, free ChatGPT websites, AI search engines, etc.
- **Just for Fun**: Sharing free content, ASMR recommendations, and some slightly happy short videos.
- **Some Gaming News**: Sharing gaming news (Star Railway (already abandoned), Back to the Future 1999...).
- **Music Sharing**: This might be more subjective, but I'm also looking for some friends with the same musical taste as me.

## >>> RrOrange's Toolkit

This week, I participated in the graduate defense of a graduate student and would like to share some interesting tools I found this week. It's really a limit-sharing performance!

### [ðŸ—¯ TurboSeek](https://www.turboseek.io/)

There are three English questions on the interface to help you quickly experience the translation:

> How does photosynthesis proceed?

2. How can I get a 6 pack in 3 months?
> How can I achieve a six-pack in three months?

The answers are divided into three sections: `resources found (SOURCE)`, `answer (ANSWER)`, and `similar topics (SIMILAR TOPICS)`.

I tried the Chinese search capability, and I searched for the latest news, which mentioned that the Chinese women's volleyball team lost to Japan, which should be quite accurate, and there are some references, you can try.
