# Vol. 003 - Jellyfish Dance

![](https://i.imgur.com/VvEqrpR.jpeg)

The cover was shot at Chimelong Ocean Kingdom. They are moon jellyfish (Aurelia aurita) with typical bell-shaped bodies and four distinct gonads that look like petal shapes. Initially thought the jellyfish really glowed, but upon further research, it was found that moon jellyfish are often displayed in aquariums and enhanced with colored lights to create a colorful appearance.

### How to improve your sleep?

This week, suddenly saw [how to improve your sleep](https://sspai.com/bullet/1718686881) on the minority party, seeing everyone's advice in the comments section suddenly struck a chord. Before starting my postgraduate studies, I used to fall asleep as soon as I lay down. However, after being pushed by my supervisor for two years and experiencing palpitations at 2 am one night last year, my sleep quality deteriorated (`from occasionally staying up all night → falling asleep at night but waking up at 4 am → falling asleep as soon as lying down`). Without further ado about the process, let's talk directly about how to improve sleep.

1. Monitor

I use the `Apple Watch + Stress Watch`. Seriously, `Stress Watch` is really good. It mainly monitors `stress (HRV), sleep, and heart rate`. Last year, I used a little magic to get it for free for a year, but this year it didn't work anymore. I tried other apps like `OtterLife` and `CapyMood`, but they were too flashy and didn't provide very intuitive displays, so I ended up paying for `Stress Watch`. To prove that I'm not joking, here is a screenshot of my purchase record:

Specific usage methods, if you use iPhone to download and use for a few days, you will know, so I won't go into details. Here are some of my data, just sharing with everyone to take a look.

Other recommendations: Pillow (left) & AutoSleep (right)

2. Meditation

I don't have a deep understanding of this aspect, but when I sleep, I focus my attention on my breathing. I only concentrate on breathing; if my attention drifts to other thoughts, I bring it back to focus on breathing. Previously, I followed some bloggers on Bilibili, such as [Li Ran in Meditation](https://space.bilibili.com/591246297) and [Fan Li Yuan](https://space.bilibili.com/63486758). However, I tried using this method during the nights when "I could fall asleep one night and couldn't fall asleep until 4 am the next," but it didn't work most of the time. Trying to concentrate on breathing was more effective. Personally, it's better not to get too obsessed with these things.

3. Sleep music + ASMR

I recommended a sleep aid app on the channel before, which is very useful. I recommend it to those who have difficulty falling asleep: `Dtd Sounds`.

> Detailed introduction：https://t.me/RrOrangeAndFriends/294

![](https://i.imgur.com/N0WVYrf.png)

I downloaded it on March 12, 2024, and have been experiencing it for nearly a month. It basically helps me fall asleep quickly every night.

There's also ASMR, which is quite subjective; if I listen to it when I'm sleepy, I fall asleep quickly, but if I'm anxious, listening to it doesn't help much.

I have saved some of my favorite videos on Telegram. If you like them too, you can follow this well-curated channel for transfers:

> The updates aren't very frequent, but they are definitely high quality.

4. Seek medical attention promptly

I was pushed by my mentor and couldn't sleep at night, experiencing palpitations. Now, looking back, it's highly likely that I developed mild anxiety due to the pressure. Last year, unable to sleep in the middle of the night, I thought about going to the hospital but ended up feeling better after just walking around the hospital entrance.

"The weekly newsletter from Big Orange and Friends can't offer you any extra advice," so if "you have trouble falling asleep, seek medical attention promptly." This topic ends here, and I also wish that all readers of my newsletter can fall asleep easily without any anxiety or insomnia issues `peace!`
