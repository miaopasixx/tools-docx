# Vol. 002 - Chimelong Ocean Kingdom

![](https://i.imgur.com/FBg1OOE.jpeg)

The cover photo was taken last week at Zhuhai Chimelong Ocean Kingdom after the weekly publication was sent out. In the picture, I captured a Manta ray in the underwater tunnel of Chimelong using my camera. Manta rays are large marine creatures known for their wide pectoral fins and streamlined bodies. They usually live in tropical and subtropical oceans, preferring to swim in open waters, especially in areas rich in plankton. Manta rays are filter-feeding fish that feed on plankton and small fish.

### Manatee

![](https://i.imgur.com/llMdBTj.jpeg)

The picture is of the manatee I saw at Chimelong. After a round of visiting, I felt that the manatee was the cutest and worth introducing to everyone. Below, I will briefly introduce what I saw based on [Wikipedia - Manatee]((https://www.wikiwand.com/zh-hans/%E6%B5%B7%E7%89%9B%E5%B1%AC)).

> **Manatees** ([/ˈmænətiːz/](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Help:IPA/English), [family](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Family_(biology)) [Trichechidae](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Trichechidae), [genus](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Genus) ***Trichechus***) are large, fully aquatic, mostly [herbivorous](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Herbivory) [marine mammals](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Marine_mammal) sometimes known as **sea cows**. There are three accepted living species of Trichechidae, representing three of the four living species in the order [Sirenia](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Sirenia): the [Amazonian manatee](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Amazonian_manatee) (*Trichechus inunguis*), the [West Indian manatee](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/West_Indian_manatee) (*Trichechus manatus*), and the [West African manatee](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/West_African_manatee) (*Trichechus senegalensis*). They measure up to 4.0 metres (13 ft 1 in) long, weigh as much as 590 kilograms (1,300 lb), and have paddle-like tails.

1. Eat

The introduction goes as follows:：
> Manatees spend about half of their time in the water sleeping, coming to the surface to breathe every 5 minutes on average, and most of the rest of the time they are feeding 1-2 meters below the surface. They mainly feed on a variety of aquatic plants, including sea grasses, algae, red mangrove leaves, and more than 60 other types of plants, but they occasionally consume fish, tunicates, and other animals.

When I see manatees, they are `mostly swimming`. The `Figure 1` in the picture above is a photo of manatees needing to come ashore to breathe and graze.

2. Speed

wiki:

> Manatees typically move at a speed of about 5-8 kilometers per hour, but can reach up to 30 kilometers per hour in short bursts.

The exact speeds can't be measured, but they certainly swim quite fast. Based on my observations at Chimelong, the order of speed is roughly: `Dolphins > Manatees > Beluga Whales`. However, it feels like the manatees and belugas are almost equally fast, yet slightly faster than each other!

3. Memoery

wiki:

> According to the research, manatees have the ability to retain long-term memory and the potential to learn complex tasks, with an intelligence in visual and sound recognition equivalent to that of dolphins. Manatees produce various sounds for mutual communication within the population, especially between mothers and their young. Adult manatees also communicate with each other for sexual activities and entertainment.

At Chimelong, I saw the performances of `dolphins, sea lions, and belugas` with the trainers, which were in perfect harmony, `but I didn't see any manatees`, which might indicate that the potential or sleep time of manatees is not as good as that of dolphins.
