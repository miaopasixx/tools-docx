# Vol.005 - KK Coffee

![](https://i.imgur.com/MDoXq2G.jpeg)

The cover photo was taken at a coffee shop on Shamian Island in Guangzhou. It was pouring rain and the weather was gloomy when I went there. Most of the shops around were closed, but this coffee shop was shining with a warm light on the street, creating a particularly atmospheric feeling. So I lifted my phone and captured this scene.

### How to quickly set up an MT-proxy for Telegram

Previously, MT was prone to issues, so I spent some time setting it up this week. Note that this is only for `overseas VPS`, domestic servers cannot use it.

1. If you `do not have` `Docker`, you can install it first:

> curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | bash -s docker

2. Install the `MT proxy`, this command uses port 8443, and you can specify another port:

> docker run --name nginx-mtproxy -d -p 8080:80 -p 8443:443 -e ip_white_list="OFF" ellermister/nginx-mtproxy:latest

3. Check the connection key:

> docker logs nginx-mtproxy

Finally, copy this `tg://proxy?server=...` to `Save Messages`, `click` it, and you can use it (this is an example below):
```shell
MTProxy Secret: 4f7g8h1j2k3l4m5n6o7p8q9r0s1t2u3v4w5x6y7z8a9b0c1d2e3f4g5h6i7j8k9l0m1n2o3p
