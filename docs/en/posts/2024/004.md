# Vol.004 - Last Dinner After Graduation

![](https://i.imgur.com/qXNxptt.jpeg)

The cover photo was taken last week, during the last dinner after graduation, which was a hot pot dinner. Our graduate advisor was invited to this dinner. Interestingly, although it seemed like the dinner was paid for by our advisor, it was not actually the case. The main reason is that the advisor in my group gives out 800 yuan to the third-year graduate students every month and takes back 500 yuan as a group fee, which is then used for team building activities (so in essence, this meal was actually paid for by our group as a treat for the teacher, sweating). And this photo was taken by me after eating hot pot, when I inadvertently lifted the camera upwards, and I feel that this inexplicable composition looks quite good!

How should Docker be installed now?

This week I helped a friend in my community install `Docker`. This friend has never used `Docker` before and has to do everything manually. Unfortunately, there is a project whose installation condition is only `Docker`, so this week he asked if I could help?

But the current situation is that `Docker` is very difficult to handle in China. In the [first phase: Self-rescue method for domestic servers after Docker Hub failure](http://localhost:5173/posts/2024/001#docker-hub%E5%A4%B1%E6%95%88%E5%90%8E%E7%9A%84%E5%9B%BD%E5%86%85%E6%9C%8D%E5%8A%A1%E5%99%A8%E8%87%AA%E6%95%91%E5%8A%9E%E6%B3%95), I have already explained how to use the mirror, but it is not very suitable for installation. Most of the tutorials on the Internet are tutorials before `Docker` was blocked, so I took a look at the active community `1Panel` post and saw the current solution for installing `Docker`:

> https://bbs.fit2cloud.com/t/topic/5891

Command:
```shell
curl https://install.1panel.live/docker-install -o docker-install && sudo bash ./docker-install && rm -f ./docker-install
```

Then you can add the mirror, create a `daemon.json` under `/etc/docker`, and add the following content:
```json
{
    "registry-mirrors": [
        "https://hub.rat.dev",
        "https://docker.1panel.live"
    ]
}
```

### The best website to learn Datalog

This week, I spent some time learning a declarative database query language, `Datalog`, which has its roots in logic programming and has similar expressive power to `SQL`.

Overall, I found it quite challenging to switch from the familiar syntax of SQL to the functional `Clojure` style. I also looked into `Clojure` syntax and studied the language environment this week. It seems that there are few people using it in China, but many people abroad are using it, along with a lot of open-source books. Finally, here is the learning website for Datalog:

> The tutorial is also open source: https://github.com/jonase/learndatalogtoday

### [Geek Music](https://music.bestgeek.org/#/)

Similar to last week's recommendation, [TuneFree](https://rrorangeandfriends.site/posts/2024/003#tunefree-Âú®Á∫øÈü≥‰πêÁΩëÁ´ô), this is an open-source music player. I personally believe it might be based on `TuneFree` with some modifications made before release. Both are user-friendly, so feel free to give them a try.

### [Emergent Mind](https://www.emergentmind.com/)

A platform designed to help users discover and learn about the latest computer science research. The website monitors discussions on social media about popular papers on `arXiv`, and then showcases these popular papers on its homepage, email digests, and X accounts. In addition, `Emergent Mind` also uses `GPT-4` to generate detailed layman's explanations to help users understand these papers. This website is a continuation of the 2014 version, when Matt Mazur attempted to use various interactive visualization techniques to teach the concept of emergence. Now, the focus of the website has shifted to teaching users about cutting-edge computer science research using generative artificial intelligence.

### [Ê©ôÁØá](https://cp.baidu.com/)

The long-form writing AI released by Baidu can also be used as an AI search engine.

Seeing the UI of this search engine and then looking at this slogan, I laughed. Isn't this imitating Kimi? Baidu really can't stand to see others doing well, if you can't beat them, just copy.

> This article shares the author's insights from reading "Inside the System - The Chinese Government and Economic Development," discussing several phenomena in China's economic development, such as the economic backwardness of administrative border areas, uneven population distribution, difficulties in the reform of county management directly by provinces, the importance of government documents and meetings, and the complexity of power operations. The author also quotes profound views from the book on government governance, land finance, local governments' models of promoting economic development, and the relationship between real estate and economic cycles. Finally, the author believes that this book has helped him to understand China's economic policies more deeply and correct some misconceptions.
